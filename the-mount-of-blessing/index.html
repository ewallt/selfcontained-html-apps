On Anger:</strong> Goes beyond murder to condemn internal anger and insults (5:21-26).<br><strong>2. On Lust:</strong> Goes beyond the act of adultery to condemn the lustful look (5:27-30).<br><strong>3. On Divorce:</strong> Restricts divorce to cases of marital unfaithfulness (5:31-32).<br><strong>4. On Oaths:</strong> Calls for simple, direct speech ('Let your \"Yes\" be \"Yes\"') instead of swearing elaborate oaths (5:33-37).<br><strong>5. On Retaliation:</strong> Replaces 'an eye for an eye' with turning the other cheek and going the extra mile (5:38-42).<br><strong>6.
