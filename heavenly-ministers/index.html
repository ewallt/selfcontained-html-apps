They can also symbolize different facets of God's character and the diverse ways His attributes are manifested.",
                  "  - The <strong>Lion</strong> (Judah's standard) speaks of Christ's kingship and power as the 'Lion of the tribe of Judah' <span class='scripture-ref'>(Revelation 5:5)</span>.",

                  "<strong>The Four Directions & Israel's Encampment <span class='scripture-ref'>(Numbers 2)</span>:</strong> The arrangement of Israel's camp around the Tabernacle, with the Tabernacle at the center and the four leading tribal divisions (Judah - East/Lion; Reuben - South/Man; Ephraim - West/Ox; Dan - North/Eagle) on each side, is seen as an earthly reflection of the heavenly order around God's throne. This symbolized God dwelling among His people, His protective presence, and the organized nature of His kingdom.",
                  "<strong>Guardians of Holiness & Access to God:</strong> Cherubim at Eden's gate <span class='scripture-ref'>(Genesis 3:24)</span> guarded the way to the tree of life, signifying that sin had barred direct access to God's life-giving presence. E.G. White notes, 'At the cherubim-guarded gate of Paradise the divine glory was revealed. Hither came Adam and his sons to worship God.' <em>(Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 62)</em>.

'These cherubs had wings...Their faces were turned toward each other, and were looking reverentially downward toward the mercy-seat, which represents all the heavenly angels looking with interest and reverence to the law of God deposited in the ark...' <em>(E.G.

                  "<strong>Preparation for Divine Service (Ezekiel's Commission):</strong> Though not a direct 'cleansing' by a cherub, Ezekiel's profound and overwhelming vision of God's glory, borne by the cherubim <span class='scripture-ref'>(Ezekiel 1-3)</span>, was essential in preparing him for his prophetic ministry. The vision humbled him and impressed upon him the majesty of the God for whom he was to speak.",
